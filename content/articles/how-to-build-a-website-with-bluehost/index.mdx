Would you like to build a website for your brand, business, product, service or create a personalised online portfolio? If Yes, then you’re on the right blog post. Some people are terrified or intimidated about the website design process; however, this blog post aims to **simplify and guide you step-by-step** on setting up and building a website for your brand, business, product, service using [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo). 

This post also shows that you don’t need a professional website developer to design a website. There are many platforms (e.g., [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo), Wix, Squarespace) that have made the website design process very user-friendly. 

Before we get started, check out some benefits of building a website for your brand/business:

* It provides more information about yourself and services (e.g., what you offer).
* You will look more professional.
* It improves your online visibility, for example, see the Google search image below.

# Let’s get started

Firstly, it’s important to understand some key concepts before getting started. For example, if we were to compare the process of developing a website, with that of building a house, it’ll be as follows:

* **Website** – The **house/location** for your brand/business on the internet.


* **Hosting platform** – This is the **land** for building the house. Examples of hosting platforms include [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo), Wix, Squarespace etc.


* **Domain name** – This is the **house address**. For example, theatenetwork.com, drsotayo.com, abbasegbeyemi.me, etc.


* **Content management system** – This is for managing the content and styling the house. For example, WordPress.



The image below also describes the analogy.

In the context of this guide, it is worth noting that WordPress is integrated with [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo) which simplifies the process of hosting your website alongside managing the files and content for your website. In addition, [Bluehost/WordPress](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo) has a lot of resources (partly due to their popularity), reliable service, excellent customer service and reviews, and is reasonably user-friendly for beginners.

# **Here’s a Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. Go to [Bluehost ](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo)and click the **Get Started** button.

2. Select the hosting plan (i.e., [Bluehost pricing)](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo) that you need. The **BASIC plan** under the **36 months** tab is an excellent option for beginners.

3. Choose a **domain** for your website. Ensure your domain name aligns with your brand or vision (quick tips – ensure that it’s easy to remember, easy to spell and reasonably short).

\-

4. You will then be asked to enter your **Account Information, Package Information**, select **Package Extras** and enter **Payment Information**. As part of the Package Extras, select **Domain Privacy + Protection** (This ensures that the public can’t find your personal details, e.g., phone number or email address).

5. Once the process is completed, install, and log in to WordPress (WordPress is integrated into [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo), so it’s reasonably straightforward). Now, the **domain, hosting** and **content management system** are secured (Well done!). 

Now, you can style your website by selecting your appropriate theme (i.e., website layout). 

To select a **Theme**, go to **Appearance** > **Themes**. You can search for themes with the relevant keywords for your brand/business (if needed, you can change the theme at a later stage).

* **Blog Page**
* **Contact Page**

# Congratulations!

You can now share your wonderful website with the world!

I hope this blog post has shown that building a website for your brand/business using [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/drsotayo) is not terrifying and can be developed within minutes. At first, it may not be perfect (also, website design can be very subjective) and may take a few changes to get it where you want it. However, in the words of Mark Zuckerberg (Founder of Facebook),

> “Ideas don’t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started.”

Therefore, you can apply this principle to showcase your excellent work with the world and get started now! Good luck!
