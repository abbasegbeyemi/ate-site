Imagine being the owner of a chain of restaurants, forecasting customer traffic could help provide insights in making strategic decisions to increase sales and revenue.
In this post, we shall tackle the problem of person/human detection in images or videos for monitoring purposes.

There are various techniques in the literature to solve the person detection problem. A very common approach used in the past is the Haar Cascade’s method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. Another approach involves computing Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG).

HoG measures the strength and orientation of image gradients (features) within an image region. An image is generally scanned from top left to bottom right with a rectangle sliding window at different scales. For each sliding window, these features are extracted and
